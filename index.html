                  <h2 id="one">Discovery of coffee</h2>
                  <p>Does anybody know where coffee came from, or when we started to drink coffee? There is an interesting story about how we started to 
                        drink coffee. It is believed Coffee is discovered by Kaldi, who is an Ethiopian goat herder from Kaffa. He was herding his goats 
                        through a highland area near a monastery and noticed the energizing effects when his flock nibbled on the bright red berries of 
                        a certain bush, chewed on the fruit himself. After noticing its effect, people started eating the red cherries at the beginning 
                        that is followed by roasting the beans, grounding up, and dissolving in hot water, which yields the world's first cup of coffee.
                        Then coffee spread throughout the middle east and from the middle East to Europe and now all over the world..</p>

                  <p>The coffee ceremony is an integral part of Ethiopia community. An invitation to attend a coffee ceremony is 
                        considered a mark of friendship or respect and is an excellent example of Ethiopian hospitality. Ethiopian coffee ceremony is 
                        an important part of their social and cultural life. The lengthy Ethiopian coffee ceremony involves processing the raw, unwashed 
                        coffee beans into a finished cups of coffee</p>

                  <h2 id="Three"> How to make coffe</h2>

                  <p>Coffee is my favorite drink. In some regions of Ethiopia, butter or honey may be added to the brew. This ceremony is a style of 
                        drinking that gives the family an opportunity to sit together and spend precious time with friends and family. Also update each 
                        other on the news or the latest events in the village. It is a moment of reflection, a moment where you can mentally relax. Coffee 
                        ,or "Buna" as called locally in Ethiopia, beans are roasted until flavorful smoke rises, then grind the roasted beans using a mortar 
                        and pestle (ground fine) and prepare the roasted and ground coffee in a spherical-shaped pot called "Jebena". The coffee is then 
                        served in traditional cups. </pheight="300" width="700">
