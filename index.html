<p>I love coffe, In some regions of Ethiopia, butter or honey may be added to the brew.
     This ceremony is a style of drinking that gives the family an opportunity to sit together and spend precious time with friends and family.
      Also update each other on the news or the newest events in the village. It is a moment of reflection, a moment where you can mentally relax. 
      Buna beans are roasted until flavorful smoke rises, grinding the roasted beans using a mortar and pestle (ground fine) and preparing the roasted and ground coffee in a spherical-shaped pot called a jebena. 
      The coffee is then served in traditional tasting cups. </p>
